## Synopsis

This gem allows a hydra application to create hls derivative media files automatically after uploading audiovisual media files, and to display those to a user through hls adaptive streaming.

## Motivation

Hydra is a promising framework for digital asset management. One Hydra based application - Avalon Media System - has relatively robust support for multimedia streaming. However, Avalon is not nearly as flexible or feature rich as Sufia (another Hydra "head") as an asset management system. Avalon also relies on a clunky party transcoding service (Matterhorn) and external streaming server (Red5 or Wowza), creating an unweildly application stack. We wanted the streaming power and flexiblity promised by Avalon, in a mature and flexible asset management system like Sufia. This gem aims to integrate all of the benefits of adaptive bitrate streaming into Sufia's existing simple, efficient system for creating multimedia derivative files.
